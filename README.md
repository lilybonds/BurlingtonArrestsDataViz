Analyzing Trends in Burlington Arrests for Basics of Data Science

## Overview
Using R and RStudio, I collaborated with my teammate Allie Siclari to visualize various relationships within a dataset logging arrests in Burlington, Vermont. Our research question: Do arrests in Burlington, Vermont from 2012 to the present support a connection between racial and gender bias and the criminal justice system? 

## Data
Our dataset comes from the City of Burlington’s Police Department. It uses data from 2012 through July of 2024. The data is updated monthly. This dataset focuses on the arrests in Burlington Vermont, meaning it is only sampling a small portion of Vermont’s and the United States’ population, but encompasses all of Burlington’s arrest data. We do not suspect any sampling bias, considering this dataset provides information on every arrest made by the Burlington Police Department, regardless of arrest type, category, age, gender, race, etc., and comes from a reliable governmental source. This dataset is an observational study that is provided to the public because arrest reports are public records in Vermont.
